2. add ImageButton with id "edit_basic_info"
3. add TextView with id "email"
4. add ImageView with id "user_picture"
5. combine these four views by LinearLayout

Advise:
If you have some questions, it is better to search in google(baidu) before asking someone else. You need PRACTICE to learn how to get what you what.
If you can not find answer, feel free to post your question in jiuzhang.com/qa or QQ group.
You can see complete code(including code of Challenge) in "master" branch.
It is always the last step to compare your code with "master"
